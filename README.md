# discordbots
A collection of Discord bots that I have coded for various reasons.


First bot created: BingusBot. 

This bot is triggered by the prefix !bingus followed by the quantity of photos requested. (Maximum set to 5 to save bandwith; can change in BingusBot.py.)

Useage example: !bingus 5 --> would send 5 pictures of Bingus within the channel invoked.

For y'all who don't know who bingus is; it's a TikTok meme.

Okay have fun, sorry for being such a noob at coding!
