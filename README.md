# discordbots
A collection of Discord.py bots that I have coded for various reasons.


Bots:

BingusBot:
Useage: This bot is triggered by the prefix !bingus followed by the quantity of photos requested. (Maximum set to 5 to save bandwith) | Example: !bingus 5 --> Would send 5 pictures of Bingus within the channel invoked. For y'all who don't know who bingus is; it's a TikTok meme.

SecondBot:
Useage: Example
